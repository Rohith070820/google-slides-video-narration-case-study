# üìΩÔ∏è Built-In Video Narration Feature for Google Slides ‚Äì Case Study

This repository presents a comprehensive research case study on integrating a **native video narration feature** into **Google Slides**. The study explores the current pain points users face when narrating slides, analyzes market viability, surveys user demand, and proposes a user-centered solution to enhance asynchronous presentation experiences.

## üìù Project Overview

Google Slides lacks a built-in mechanism to record and attach video narrations per slide. Users currently rely on third-party tools like Loom, OBS, or PowerPoint, resulting in fragmented workflows and technical frustration. This project aims to:

- Identify key user challenges and expectations
- Benchmark competitive platforms (Canva, PowerPoint, Prezi, etc.)
- Quantify demand through survey analysis
- Propose a UI/UX solution for native integration
- Recommend a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and development roadmap

## üìä Key Findings

- **88%** of users reported needing video/audio narration in their presentations
- **75%** found current tools (Loom, Canva, etc.) difficult or time-consuming
- **87.8%** want in-app recording directly inside Google Slides
- **66.7%** would be *very likely* to use the feature if implemented

---

## üí° Proposed Solution

- Record narration per slide inside Google Slides
- Preview, re-record, or delete individual slide narrations
- Seamless Google Drive storage and sharing
- Support for embedded playback within presentations

Mockups and competitive analyses using **Kano** and **RICE** frameworks are included in the study to justify feature prioritization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

- Auto-captions and transcriptions
- Speaker notes-to-script generation
- Viewer analytics dashboard
- Multilingual narration support
